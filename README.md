# AbaloneSetDataMining

This repository contains code and resources related to a data mining project focused on the Abalone dataset. 

**Project Overview:**

The Abalone dataset contains information about abalone (sea snails), including their age, sex, and various physical measurements. This project aims to:

* **Explore and analyze the Abalone dataset** to understand the relationships between different attributes.
* **Develop and evaluate predictive models** to estimate the age of abalone based on their physical characteristics.
* **Investigate different data mining techniques** such as:
    * **Data preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
    * **Feature selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for age prediction.
    * **Machine learning algorithms:** 
        * Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc.)
        * Other relevant machine learning models.
* **Evaluate model performance** using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).

**Project Structure:**

* **results:** Stores model outputs, visualizations, and evaluation metrics in index.html.
